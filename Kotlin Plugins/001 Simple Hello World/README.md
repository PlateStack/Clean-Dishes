Simple Hello World
==================
This is a simple project to demonstrate the minimum necessary configuration to start your
plate plugin.

The class must have a `@Plate` annotation and must extends `PlatePlugin`.

You can have how many plugins you want inside a single project, there's no need for extra files.

Make sure to check the [build.gradle](build.gradle) file too.
